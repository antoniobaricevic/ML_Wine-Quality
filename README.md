# Machine Learning - Wine Quality

The goal is to predict the quality of red and white wine. It can be a classification or regression. Decided to try with regression - predict the quality score.

#### Data set Information
The two datasets are related to red and white variants of the Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine. The data set is publicly available. P. Cortez, A. Cerdeira, F. Almeida, T. Matos and J. Reis. Modeling wine preferences by data mining from physicochemical properties. In Decision Support Systems, Elsevier, 47(4):547-553, 2009.

#### ML models
1. Linear Regression
2. Polynomial Regression
3. Decision Tree Regression
4. Random Forest Regression
5. XGBoost
6. CatBoost
7. XGBoost with Hyperparameter Tuning

#### Note
In two Python notebooks because there is a significant difference in properties between red and white wine therefore the models were made separately.
Also, the data set has too many outliers (more than 20%), so two versions have been created: with dropping outliers and without dropping outliers.
